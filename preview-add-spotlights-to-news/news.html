                    David Swanson Memorial Award winner, Connor Natzke’s journey with the OSG Consortium began in 2019
as a student of the OSG User School.
Today, nearly three years later, Natzke has executed 600,000 simulations with the help of OSG staff
and prior OSG programming. These simulations, each of them submitted as a job, logged over 135,000
core hours provided by the Open Science Pool (OSPool). Natzke’s history with the OSG Consortium
reflects a pattern of learning, adapting, and improving that translates to the acceleration and
expansion of scientific discovery.

                    Researchers harnassing the capacity of the OSPool are racking up record-breaking numbers. On June 8, the OSPool, which provides computing resources to researchers across the country, went over 1.1 million core hours –– a daily record number. To put this in perspective, one million core hours is equivalent to using 42 thousand cores in just one day. That is close to half the size of some large supercomputing centers. In short, an increasing number of researchers are utilizing the OSG to carry out an incredible amount of computing.

                    The OSG consortium is nearing the completion of migrating its software stack to the WebDAV data transfer protocol - a widely used, industry-compatible and secure protocol. The WebDAV protocol which is an extension of the well-known HTTP allows Third-Party-Copy transfers which are commonly used to move bulk data between storage systems worldwide. Moreover, WebDav is compatible with the OAuth2 mechanism for authentication.

                    The OSG User School 2017 was held at the University of Wisconsin–Madison on July 17–21.
There were 56 participants, including mostly graduate students, post-doctoral researchers,
a few advanced undergraduates, several faculty, and some research staff from research
institutions in the United States (and one each from England and Spain). The range of
scholarly domains was one of the most diverse yet, including physics, biology, chemistry,
medicine, engineering, statistics, earth sciences, plant sciences, and economics. Participants
were selected by demonstrating need for large-scale computing and by being in a position
to transform their scholarly work through computation. The instructors this year were Bala
Desinghu, Brian Lin, and Derek Weitzel from the OSG, plus Christina Koch and Lauren Michael
from the UW–Madison’s Center for High Throughput Computing.

                    On October 1, 2017, Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish, and Kip Thorne were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics “for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves.” LIGO confirmed the first direct observation of gravitational waves on September 14, 2015. Both LIGO detectors, one in Hanford, Washington, and one in Livingston, Louisiana, observed a gravitational wave from the merger of two black holes, and with that, the final piece of Einstein’s general theory of relativity fell into place.

Three of them — TRAPPIST-1e, f and g — dwell in their star’s so-called “habitable zone.”
The habitable zone, or Goldilocks zone, is a band around every star (shown here in green)
where astronomers have calculated that temperatures are just right — not too hot, not too
cold — for liquid water to pool on the surface of an Earth-like world.

two detectors, researchers can use differences in the wave’s arrival times
to constrain the source location in the sky. LIGO’s first data run of
its advanced gravitational wave detectors began in September 2015 and
ran through January 12, 2016. The first gravitational waves were
detected on September 14, 2015 by both detectors.
