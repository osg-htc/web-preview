        <p>Scott Cole, a neuroscience PhD student at University of California San Diego, wrote an article which appeared in PythonWeekly that details how to get up and running on Open Science Pool.  “I was starting to run into computational limitations in my neuroscience research, but I didn’t have any experience speeding up my work with something like high throughput computing,” said Cole.  When Cole saw that there was an opportunity at the OSG User School to learn how to use OSG and the free access to resources it provides, he jumped on it.</p>

<p>While at the OSG User School, Cole was able to use the tutorials in the curriculum to work his way through using the Open Science Pool.  Despite being jet lagged due to a flight from Hong Kong, Scott, with the help of the instructors, was able to get a handle on distributed high-throughput computing. “Since the learning process was so streamlined, it made it much easier to learn the necessary tools to utilize the Open Science Pool,” he said.</p>

<p>Of his research, Cole says, “My lab studies neural oscillations, or brain rhythms. When we record electrical activity from almost any brain region, we see a diverse set of rhythms, which reflect the brain’s computation in that region. We are interested in the biological mechanisms that generate these rhythms, and how they influence the brain’s information processing.”</p>
