<p>Just over a year ago, Cort Posnansky, now a member of the <a href="https://www.ligo.org/">LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration</a> (LVK) and the recipient of the 2024 <a href="https://osg-htc.org/outreach/swanson-award/">David Swanson Award</a>, began his tenure as a student at the annual week-long OSG School. While at the School I “learned a lot of the tools for how to do high throughput computing, how to interact with HTCondor and to run jobs on a cluster,” all of which were crucial in his work, Posnansky said. He used this knowledge for his own research, and explained to the HTC24 audience how he “manages workloads more efficiently… to help detect gravitational waves.”</p>

<p>As this year’s David Swanson Award presentation, Posnansky shared at HTC24 how he applied his skills learned to his research with the LVK collaboration. Posnansky explained his work and its important relationship with throughput computing. When searching for new waves from astrophysical collisions by running the data analysis to find signals, “the nature of the work requires high throughput computing” Posnansky said.</p>

<p>Throughput computing has allowed the LVK collaboration to research “a new form of astronomy because we have a whole new way of observing the universe through gravitational waves,” Posnansky said. He explained how gravity from black holes and neutron stars pulls the objects together, and the eventual collision leads to the emission of gravitational waves, “which are ripples in space-time itself,” Posnansky explained. “And as these waves reach Earth, we can detect those.”</p>

<p>Posnansky reported that throughput computing was necessary so that they [the LVK] could “do more science, allowing us to search more waveforms, leading to new discoveries.” This wide range of research, however, requires collaboration and commitment, and Posnansky and the LVK team have dedicated themselves to this mission</p>

<p>He also noted the global collaboration and infrastructure that supports his work, which has built observatories located around the world. The current observing run includes two LIGO sites in the United States, the Virgo site in Italy, and the KAGRA site in Japan.</p>

<figcaption>LIGO observatory with O4 observing tunnels.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Lasers are used to monitor “the length of the tunnels of these observatories, which are kilometers long,” Posnansky noted. These tunnels aim to “measure a change in distance that is less than the width of a proton.”</p>

<p>Posnansky explained that LVK data analysis involves comparing the collected signals from the different observatories to build more confidence in the actual detection. His team must also pre-compute waveforms based on properties of other black hole parameters, which are then fed into computing clusters. “And we do that with millions of waveforms, which is why high throughput computing comes into play,” Posnansky said. These precomputed waveforms are then analyzed by the pipeline, which searches for matches in the collected data. Posnansky pointed out that the stronger the signal-to-noise ratio, the clearer the correlation between the signal and the pre-computed waveform, and this is how events are detected.</p>

<p>Both OSPool and Open Science Data Federation (“OSDF”) have played a part in the LVK’s work. Posnansky explained how they use the computing capacity of the OSPool and the HTCondor software to analyze and then organize tasks into a directed acyclic graph. This allows Posnansky to manage the complex computations required for archival searches and real-time detections of gravitational waves. These services also opened up avenues for Posnansky to further his black hole research; jobs run using HTCondor have revealed the mass distribution of black holes in the universe, and shown how often collisions occur between them. Posnansky’s current goals focus on developing a workflow to better leverage OSDF, improving efficiency for large analyses.</p>

  <figcaption class="figure-caption"> <br /> “ ”</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Shifting gears towards the future, Posnansky remarked that  “The goal has always been to improve our throughput,” he said. “If we can do this, we can search for more waveforms, and more types of waveforms.” Posnansky is determined to expand the execution of work with the OSPool.</p>

<p>Even with significant progress, the work still faces a fair share of difficulties. Due to the size and number of network transfers that the LVK is running, the throughput environment can sometimes be challenging. However, the regular communication with the OSG facilitation team has helped alleviate issues the LVK encountered.</p>

<p>The David Swanson Award, created by the OSG Consortium, honors the memory of David Swanson. Swanson was instrumental in establishing the Holland Computing Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and played a key role in the expansion of the OSG and research computing efforts. David Swanson “embodied the exact spirit of what we [OSG] are trying to do” OSG executive director, Frank Wurthwein said at HTC24.</p>

<p>The award is honored annually to former OSG school students, as both Swanson and the OSG school share a passion for helping others develop skills and advancing science with throughput computing.</p>

<p>Reflecting on his research and experience with the OSG School, Posnansky has already shared his new skills with colleagues and has also taught similar HTC workshops at Penn State University. Just as the David Swanson Award was intended, Cort Posnansky has taken full advantage of the computing resources and has used these experiences to help strengthen and grow the high throughput community.</p>

<p>Included in the award presentation was Ronda Swanson, widow of David. Despite not being in physical attendance, Ronda briefly spoke about David, and the recipient, Posnansky. “I think about how much he [David] loved science, and all of you [OSG],” she concluded. “You have hard things in life. I think it’s really important to pick the hard thing, and do it, and if you keep going, you’re going to do fantastic.”</p>
