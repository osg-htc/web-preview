The VLA is one of the most sensitive telescopes\nin the radio band that can provide more sensitive images of the universe\nthan any other radio telescope in the world. This, however, requires processing\nlarge volumes of data and super-computer class computing\nresources. The VLASS is designed to produce a large collection\nof radio data available to wide range of scientists within the astronomical\ncommunity. VLASS's science goal is to produce a radio, all-sky survey that\nwill benefit the entire astronomical community. As VLASS completes its three\nscans of the sky separated by approximately 32 months, new developments in\ndata processing techniques will allow scientists an opportunity to download data\ninstantly on potentially millions of astronomical radio sources.\n\nThe data in this data origin consists of interferometric visibilities stored in \n([Measurement Set (MS)](https://casa.nrao.edu/Memos/229.html)) format. Each\ndataset contains calibrated visibilities for one of the sixteen spectral windows\nof the VLA and covers an area of 4 square degrees (2 degrees x 2 degrees) in the\nsky. All sixteen spectral windows are combined to generate a single image, so that\nthe data contained in this data origin can be used to make images of approximately \n70 regions in the sky, each image covering 4 square degrees. The [LibRA software\npackage](https://github.com/ARDG-NRAO/LibRA) is used to transform visibilities to\nimages. The architecture and design considerations for LibRA are shown in [this\npresentation](https://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~sbhatnag/Talks/For_BrianB.pdf).\n\nTeams of scientists at the [National Radio Astronomy Observatory\n(NRAO)](http://www.nrao.edu), Socorro, NM and the Center for High Throughput Computing\n(CHTC) have used the PATh and NRP facilities of the OSG to make the\ndeepest image in the radio band of the Hubble Ultra-deep Field\n(HUDF).  Similarly, the COSMOS HI Large Extra Galactic Survey\n(CHILES)[http://chiles.astro.columbia.edu/] project has 1000 hr of integration with the VLA on the\nCOSMOS field. Imaging the CHILES data using PATh and NRP facilities\ndelivered the deepest radio image of this region of the sky, at an\nunmatched data processing throughput. Similarly to the VLASS data stored in this\ndata origin, the data for HUDF and CHILES is stored in the PATh facility data origin.\nThese recent large scale imaging achievements that were made possible through\nuse of OSG resources are reported in this [NRAO Newsletter article]\n(https://science.nrao.edu/enews/17.3/index.shtml#deepimaging) and [this press\nrelease](https://public.nrao.edu/news/astronomers-study-the-universe-300-times-faster/).\n","organization":"National Radio Astronomy Observatory","dataVisibility":"public","size":4068193022771,"objectCount":36068,"fieldOfScience":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","numberOfDatasets":15962,"rank":0,"inProgress":false,"display":true,"name":"NRAO VLASS","namespace":["/nrao-ardg"],"thirtyDayReads":16440925390027,"oneYearReads":280427321936701,"organizationUrl":"https://public.nrao.edu/vlass/","repositoryUrl":null,"publicObject":"/nrao-ardg/fmadsen/vlass-32PIMS/data/T23t17/J161533+503000/VLASS2.1.sb38528342.eb38565674.59072.03519471065_split_SPW0.ms.tgz"},"nrp-cachetest":{"description":"Namespace used by Fabio for ongoing CheckMK testing of NRP caches\n","organization":"University of California, San Diego","dataVisibility":"public","size":null,"objectCount":null,"fieldOfScience":"Computer and Information Sciences and Support Services","numberOfDatasets":null,"rank":0,"inProgress":false,"display":false,"name":"CheckMK Probe Namespace","namespace":["/nrp/cachetest"],"thirtyDayReads":854213001500,"oneYearReads":2395013261465260,"publicObject":null,"organizationUrl":null,"repositoryUrl":null},"nrp-osdf":{"description":"","organization":null,"dataVisibility":null,"size":null,"bytesXferd":null,"url":null,"fieldOfScience":null,"numberOfDatasets":null,"rank":0,"inProgress":false,"display":false,"name":null,"namespace":["/nrp/osdf"],"thirtyDayReads":65536,"oneYearReads":1475164654373560,"publicObject":null,"organizationUrl":null},"nrp-protected-xenon-biggrid-nl":{"description":"The [XENON Dark Matter Project](https://xenonexperiment.org/) is a scientific\ncollaboration organized around the XENONnT dark matter detector at the INFN\n[Gran Sasso National Laboratory](https://www.lngs.infn.it/en/lngs-overview) in\nGran Sasso, Italy.\n\nThis repository is used to store data and simulations from the XENONnT experiment\nto aid in its computing workloads.\n","organization":"University of Chicago","dataVisibility":"private","size":null,"fieldOfScience":"Physical Sciences","numberOfDatasets":null,"rank":0,"inProgress":false,"display":true,"name":"XENONnT Dark Matter","namespace":["/nrp/protected/xenon-biggrid-nl/"],"thirtyDayReads":0,"oneYearReads":152114667948168,"organizationUrl":"https://www.uchicago.edu/en","repositoryUrl":{"url":"https://xenonexperiment.org/"}},"nrp-sio":{"description":"Scripps Institution of Oceanography scientists conduct fundamental research to\nunderstand and protect the planet, and investigate our oceans, Earth, and atmosphere\nto find solutions to our greatest environmental challenges.\n","organization":"Scripps Institute of Oceanography","dataVisibility":"private","size":null,"objectCount":null,"fieldOfScience":"Biological and Biomedical Sciences","numberOfDatasets":null,"rank":1,"inProgress":false,"display":true,"name":"Scripps Institute of Oceanography","namespace":["/nrp/sio"],"thirtyDayReads":38384294620,"oneYearReads":38428297113,"organizationUrl":"https://scripps.ucsd.edu/","repositoryUrl":null},"nsdf":{"description":"","organization":"Morgridge Institute for Research","dataVisibility":"public","size":null,"bytesXferd":null,"url":"https://morgridge.org/research/research-computing/","fieldOfScience":null,"numberOfDatasets":null,"rank":0,"inProgress":false,"display":false,"name":null,"namespace":["/nsdf"],"thirtyDayReads":5692199277,"oneYearReads":51536059619,"publicObject":null,"organizationUrl":"https://morgridge.org/research/research-computing/"},"osdf-tutorial":{"description":"Datasets for use in OSDF usage tutorials by [Pelican Platform](https://pelicanplatform.org) facilitation team.\n\nThis repository supports the education and workforce development mission of the\nPelican Project.\n","organization":"University of Wisconsin -

  <p>Radio astronomy data from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS).</p>

<p>As written in the <a href="https://public.nrao.edu/vlass/">VLASS homepage</a>,
VLASS is a survey of the universe through the use of the Very Large
Array (VLA) in New Mexico. The VLA is one of the most sensitive telescopes
in the radio band that can provide more sensitive images of the universe
than any other radio telescope in the world. This, however, requires processing
large volumes of data and super-computer class computing
resources. The VLASS is designed to produce a large collection
of radio data available to wide range of scientists within the astronomical
community. VLASS’s science goal is to produce a radio, all-sky survey that
will benefit the entire astronomical community. As VLASS completes its three
scans of the sky separated by approximately 32 months, new developments in
data processing techniques will allow scientists an opportunity to download data
instantly on potentially millions of astronomical radio sources.</p>

<p>The data in this data origin consists of interferometric visibilities stored in 
(<a href="https://casa.nrao.edu/Memos/229.html">Measurement Set (MS)</a>) format. Each
dataset contains calibrated visibilities for one of the sixteen spectral windows
of the VLA and covers an area of 4 square degrees (2 degrees x 2 degrees) in the
sky. All sixteen spectral windows are combined to generate a single image, so that
the data contained in this data origin can be used to make images of approximately 
70 regions in the sky, each image covering 4 square degrees. The <a href="https://github.com/ARDG-NRAO/LibRA">LibRA software
package</a> is used to transform visibilities to
images. The architecture and design considerations for LibRA are shown in <a href="https://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~sbhatnag/Talks/For_BrianB.pdf">this
presentation</a>.</p>

<p>Teams of scientists at the <a href="http://www.nrao.edu">National Radio Astronomy Observatory
(NRAO)</a>, Socorro, NM and the Center for High Throughput Computing
(CHTC) have used the PATh and NRP facilities of the OSG to make the
deepest image in the radio band of the Hubble Ultra-deep Field
(HUDF).  Similarly, the COSMOS HI Large Extra Galactic Survey
(CHILES)[http://chiles.astro.columbia.edu/] project has 1000 hr of integration with the VLA on the
COSMOS field. Imaging the CHILES data using PATh and NRP facilities
delivered the deepest radio image of this region of the sky, at an
unmatched data processing throughput. Similarly to the VLASS data stored in this
data origin, the data for HUDF and CHILES is stored in the PATh facility data origin.
These recent large scale imaging achievements that were made possible through
use of OSG resources are reported in this [NRAO Newsletter article]

  <p>Testing and Validation Origin</p>


  <p>The Dark Energy Survey (DES) will probe the origin of the accelerating universe and help uncover the nature of dark energy
by measuring the 14-billion-year history of cosmic expansion with high precision. A 570M-pix camera, the DECam, is being
built for this project and  comprehensive tests were successfully accomplished at Fermilab’s telescope simulator (pictured above).
As we countdown to DECam’s first light, workload and excitement increase among our collaborators. Starting in late 2011 and
continuing for five years, DES will survey a large swath of the southern sky out to vast distances in order to provide new clues
to this most fundamental of questions.</p>

<p>DES uses the OSDF to deliver common data inputs for large-scale simulation jobs distributed across the US.</p>


  <p>The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment is an international flagship experiment to unlock the mysteries of neutrinos.
DUNE scientists will paint a clearer picture of the universe and how it works. Their research may even give us the key
to understanding why we live in a matter-dominated universe — in other words, why we are here at all.</p>

<p>DUNE will pursue three major science goals: find out whether neutrinos could be the reason the universe is made of matter;
look for subatomic phenomena that could help realize Einstein’s dream of the unification of forces; and watch for neutrinos
emerging from an exploding star, perhaps witnessing the birth of a neutron star or a black hole.</p>

<p>DUNE uses the OSDF to deliver common data inputs for large-scale simulation jobs distributed across the US.</p>


  <p>The ICARUS neutrino detector measures 65 feet long and weighs 760 tons. It began its life in <a href="https://www.lngs.infn.it/en/lngs-overview">Gran Sasso Laboratory</a> in
Italy, seeking out elusive particles using pioneering technology. It later spent two years undergoing upgrades at <a href="https://cern.ch/">CERN</a>,
the European particle physics laboratory and home of the Large Hadron Collider. It moved to Fermilab in 2017 and was
installed in its detector hall in 2018, where along with the new Cosmic Ray Tagger it forms the far detector for the
Short-Baseline Neutrino program.</p>

<p>The ICARUS collaboration is investigating signs of physics that may point to a new kind of neutrino called the sterile
neutrino. Other experiments have made measurements that suggest a departure from the standard three-neutrino model. ICARUS
is also investigating the various probabilities of a neutrino interacting with different types of matter as well as
neutrino-related astrophysics topics.</p>

<p>ICARUS uses the OSDF to deliver common data inputs for large-scale simulation jobs distributed across the US.</p>


  <p>MINERvA (Main Injector Neutrino ExpeRiment to study v-A interactions) is the first neutrino experiment in the
world to use a high-intensity beam to study neutrino reactions with five different nuclei, creating the first
self-contained comparison of interactions in different elements. While this type of study has previously been
done using beams of electrons, this is a first for neutrinos.</p>

<p>MINERvA is providing the world’s best, high-precision measurements of neutrino interactions on various nuclei,
in the 1-to 10-GeV energy range. MINERvA’s results are being used as inputs to current and future experiments
seeking to study neutrino oscillations, or the ability of neutrinos to change their type.</p>

<p>MINERvA uses the OSDF to deliver common data inputs for large-scale simulation jobs distributed across the US.</p>


  <p>The NOvA (NuMI Off-axis ve Appearance) experiment is shedding light on one of nature’s most elusive particles: neutrinos.
Since the late 1990s, physicists have known that neutrinos exhibit a quantum mechanical behavior called oscillations. But
this behavior is not predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics. NOvA is working to better understand these strange
particles through precision measurements of their oscillation properties.</p>

<p>NOvA uses the OSDF to deliver common data inputs for large-scale simulation jobs distributed across the US.</p>


  <p>The international Short-Baseline Neutrino Program at Fermilab examines the properties of neutrinos,
specifically how the flavor of a neutrino changes as it moves through space and matter. The program
emerged from a joint proposal, submitted by three scientific collaborations, to use particle detectors
to perform sensitive searches for ve appearance and νμ disappearance in the Booster Neutrino Beam. All
of the detectors are types of liquid-argon time projection chambers, and each contributes to the
development of this particle detection technology for the long-baseline Deep Underground Neutrino Experiments
(DUNE).</p>

<p>SBN uses the OSDF to deliver common data inputs for large-scale simulation jobs distributed across the US.</p>


  <p>The <a href="https://sbn-nd.fnal.gov/">Short-Baseline Near Detector</a> (SBND) is a 112-ton active mass liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC)
neutrino detector that sits only 110-m from the target of the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at Fermilab. SBND is
the near detector in the Short-Baseline Neutrino Program. ICARUS is the far detector in the program, and
MicroBooNE ran previously in the same beam.</p>

<p>SBND will record over a million neutrino interactions per year. By providing such a high statistics measurement
of the un-oscillated content of the BNB, SBND plays a critical role in performing searches for neutrino oscillations
at the SBN Program. The large data sample will also allow studies of neutrino-argon interactions in the GeV energy
range with unprecedented precision. The physics of these interactions is an important element of future neutrino
experiments that will employ the LArTPC technology, such as the long-baseline Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, <a href="https://www.dunescience.org/">DUNE</a>.</p>

<p>SBND uses the OSDF to deliver common data inputs for large-scale simulation jobs distributed across the US.</p>


  <p>MicroBooNE is a large 170-ton liquid-argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) neutrino experiment located on the Booster
neutrino beamline at Fermilab. The experiment first started collecting neutrino data in October 2015.</p>

<p>MicroBooNE investigates the low energy excess events observed by the MiniBooNE experiment, measure a suite of low
energy neutrino cross sections, and investigate astro-particle physics.</p>
